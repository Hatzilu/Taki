          or (c) using a SuperTaki or Switch Color.

          It may be used only in the next round.

        An Action Card can affect the player who uses it, the next player or all the players.
        These cards are the heart of the game and the key to winning.
    Stop - The next player loses his turn.
    +2 - Forces the next player to draw 2 cards or discard another +2 which forces the next player to draw 4 or follow with a +2 as well, etc. The player who cannot follow with a +2 must draw 2 cards for every +2 card which has been played. After he collected the cards, the last +2 card in the draw pile is free to be used as a color or a number.
    Switch Color - Allows the user to determine the color to be played by the next player. This card may be played at any time except after +2 which is still active.
    TAKI â€“ Discarding a TAKI card allows a player to follow with all the cards of the same color as the TAKI. NOTE: You may NOT play any other colors during a Taki run except the color of the leading Taki card.

    A TAKI card must be closed at the end of its use by pressing the End Turn button.

            SuperTaki - A wild TAKI which can be any color.
            Plus - This card forces the user to play again. If the player cannot play another card he must draw."
